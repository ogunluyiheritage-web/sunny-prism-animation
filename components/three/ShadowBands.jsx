/*
 * The shadow, the bands and the sliver — chapters 4 to 6 of Sunny's
 * walkthrough, carried by ONE set of four quads that morphs between three
 * states, so the page reads as one thing changing rather than three props
 * swapped in and out:
 *
 *   A  shadow    the prism's silhouette triangle laid flat on the grid and
 *                sheared away from a light on the left: "it casts a triangular
 *                2D shadow... it's isometric, but the shape of it is just a 2D
 *                triangle". A mirrored second triangle slides in to meet it —
 *                the pair in `image8.png`.
 *   B  sliver    the same bands stood upright in the prism's centre plane, the
 *                slice from the apex down to the base mid-line that `image2.gif`
 *                lifts out: "the center of this prism, middle line to the top".
 *   C  ribbons   the bands spread into a labelled stack — the "text ribbons"
 *                the sliver morphs into, which the view then zooms into.
 *
 * The bands are the prism's own silhouette triangle cut by the same diagonal
 * system as the solid (k = 2x + y at 0, -1, -2), so the shadow comes apart
 * exactly where the prism does.
